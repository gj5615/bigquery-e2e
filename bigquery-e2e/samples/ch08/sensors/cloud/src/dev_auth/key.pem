This file should be replaced with the private key for the robot
account configured in ./auth.py

Google Cloud Console supplies the key in PCKS12 (.p12) format which
is not supported by the crypto libraries available in the AppEngine
python runtime. You need to convert to the PKCS1 (.pem) format.

Run:
  openssl pkcs12 -in key.p12 -out key.pem -nodes -nocerts
  openssl rsa -in key.pem -out /tmp/key-rsa.pem

The replace this file with the contents of /tmp/key-rsa.pem
